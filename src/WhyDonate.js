        <h2>Why Donate?</h2>
        <p>Animal Rescue becomes a difficult task when there is passion in the work being done, but with no means of sustenance. This is the case in most animal rescue centers, especially in Kashmir. 
Almost all centers are volunteer-based, non-profit organizations. Most of the animals they rescue are terribly injured, wrought with maggots, living in pathetic conditions without water or food. Can we even say that they are “living”, when the situation is so dire? 
</p>
        To fulfill these demands the centers need:<br />
        <b>Food</b>: at least twice a day for each animal at the shelter.<br />
        <b>Medications</b>: which are expensive and scarcely in many areas of Kashmir.<br />
        <b>Special Items</b>: like baby formula for newborns, ambulances for traveling to rescue the animals.<br />
        <b>Space</b>: for making a shelter, which they scarcely have,the list is endless.<br /><br />
        And the source of money? <b>Their own pockets.</b><br />
        A major issue the animal centers face hence becomes the dire lack of funds. This stems from the lack of awareness in the region about the need and importance of Animal Rescue.
        Most centers resort to paying for the towering bills themselves. They get rescues, care for them in the best possible way, pay an immense amount, get more rescues and this cycle goes on till one day, they can’t do this anymore. 
        <br /><br />Donations are paramount for running animal rescue centers. They need help, so they can help. So the maggot infested dog, the cat who got badly bitten, the horse that lost its leg, the pup who got abandoned, can all get the help they deserve.
